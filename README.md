# Robust Drone-Vehicle Routing Problem Instances

This repository contains problem instances and solutions for the working paper "An Exact Algorithm for Robust Drone-Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows" written by Jaegwan Joo and Chungmok Lee.

## Instances

- UPS Instances: Randomly generated from a real-life use case of UPS in the area of NC, US. Refer to Kang and Lee (2020) for details.
- Solomon Instances: Well-known VRPTW instances by Solomon (1987).
